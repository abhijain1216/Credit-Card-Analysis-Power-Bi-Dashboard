# Credit-Card-Analysis-Power-Bi-Dashboard

### *Project Summary*
Analyzed weekly credit card data and developed transaction and customer dashboards. Data was loaded into an SQL database and imported into Power BI Desktop to derive actionable insights. The dataset included features such as transaction amounts, interest earned, card categories, utilization ratios, customer demographics, and income details. The Transaction Analysis Dashboard highlights spending trends, transaction types, revenue by categories, and revenue growth, while the Customer Analysis Dashboard explores customer behavior and transaction patterns. Streamlined data processing and analysis enable efficient monitoring of key performance metrics and trends, while dashboard findings offer practical recommendations to enhance decision-making processes.
